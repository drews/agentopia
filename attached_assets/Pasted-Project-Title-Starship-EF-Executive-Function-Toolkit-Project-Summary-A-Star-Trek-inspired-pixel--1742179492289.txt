Project Title
Starship EF (Executive Function) Toolkit

Project Summary
A Star Trek–inspired, pixel-art framework that serves as an executive functioning personal toolkit. The experience uses layered metaphors—Space, Ship, Chambers, and Stations—to help users manage real-world tasks, commitments, and reflections with a sense of playful immersion.

Key Objectives
Executive Function Mapping

Represent real-life commitments, goals, and tasks as interactive elements and “agents.”
Provide structured ways to plan, prioritize, and reflect across multiple “zoom” levels.
Modular Architecture

Each zoom level (Space, Ship, Chambers, Stations) is a self-contained module.
User data (agents, resources, missions) persists and updates across these modules.
Engaging Visual & Interactive Elements

Retro pixel-art aesthetic.
Basic animations or transitions to keep the user engaged.
Whimsical references to sci-fi and role-playing game tropes.
Usability & Iterability

Onboarding flow that helps first-time users understand how to map personal executive-function tasks into the starship metaphor.
Scalable design to add or modify Chambers, Stations, or agent types.
Detailed Components
Start Screen

Purpose: Serve as a playful welcome and orientation.
Features:
Pixel-art starfield animation or a simple ship-flyby to draw users in.
On click or key press, transitions into the main UI.
Optional quick tutorial or “log entry” explaining the starship metaphor.
Environmental Views (Four Levels of Zoom)

Space (Macro-Level)

Analogy: Represents larger life commitments and influences (values, interests, missions).
Behavior:
Clickable celestial objects (planets, asteroids) symbolizing major areas of focus or big goals.
Hover for short tooltips (e.g., “Core Value: Lifelong Learning”).
Gateway to deeper zoom levels.
Your Ship (Meso-Level)

Analogy: The user’s main command center for navigating life.
Behavior:
Top-down or side-view pixel-art spaceship.
Animated “agent” sprites (representing sub-tasks, personal personas, or events) traveling between rooms.
Agents have priority levels or “missions,” possibly indicated by an icon or color tag.
Ship Chambers (Functional Lenses)

Analogy: Different perspectives or roles (e.g., Bridge for strategic thinking, Medbay for self-care, etc.).
Behavior:
Agents enter a Chamber to pick up resources or instructions.
Chambers can be customized or “unlocked” as user explores different executive-function strategies.
Example Chambers:
Bridge: High-level planning (calendar, timeline).
Ready Room: Personal reflection or journaling.
Medbay: Well-being check-ins or stress-level monitoring.
Conference Room: Collaborative or social goals (meeting logs, group tasks).
Ship Stations (Micro-Level)

Analogy: Direct tools or low-level tasks that support day-to-day functioning (e.g., to-do lists, timers, daily logs).
Behavior:
Interactive consoles for detail editing of tasks, deadlines, resources.
Progress bars or status indicators for each station.
Agents can “dock” here to perform micro-tasks (e.g., marking tasks complete).
Detail Views

Agent’s Character Sheet

Layout:
Left Pane: Pixel-art avatar + scrollable D&D-style attribute table (e.g., “Willpower,” “Focus,” “Time Budget”).
Right Pane:
Top: Agent journal (logs of what tasks or “quests” they’ve accomplished).
Bottom: Tabbed interface for inventory (resources or notes) and skill sets.
Navigation Planning

Analogy: Plotting a starship course to reflect real-life scheduling or milestone planning.
Behavior:
Interactive map showing the user’s primary goals, with potential routes indicating order or priority.
Agents or tasks can be dragged/dropped onto a route or timeline for scheduling.
Artifact Inspection

Purpose: Deep dives into specific commitments, mental models, or intangible “artifacts.”
Behavior:
Optional “mini-games” or puzzles that help externalize or break down large commitments.
Provide reflective prompts or sub-tasks upon inspection (e.g., “Research needed,” “Awaiting feedback from mentor”).
Technical & Development Notes
Structure & Modularity

Develop each zoom level as a separate module/class/component to facilitate future expansion.
Use a central data store (e.g., Redux, Vuex, or React Context) for tracking agents, tasks, and resources across the entire starship metaphor.
User Data & Persistence

Plan a persistent storage layer (could be local storage, a small backend, or a cloud database) for saving user progress.
Handle user authentication or guest mode if desired for a more minimal MVP.
Iteration & Feedback

Include basic analytics or logs so users can see how frequently they engage, which Chambers or Stations are used the most, etc.
Build in a reflection prompt or daily summary to reinforce the executive functioning aspect.
Look & Feel

Emphasize minimal friction in UI: large clickable areas, clear tooltips, consistent color palette.
Keep pixel-art assets optimized and modular to swap them easily in future updates.
Next Steps

Create wireframes or placeholder pixel-art assets for each major view.
Implement a minimal clickable prototype to validate user flow.
Gather feedback, refine the user onboarding experience, and expand detail views as needed.
