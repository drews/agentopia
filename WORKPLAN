Below is a **prompt-driven development work plan** tailored for **demonstrating an MVP** of the Executive Assistant Agent as quickly as possible, **before** focusing on productionizing steps like Docker and advanced CI/CD. The plan is broken down into Jira-like tickets, each describing a distinct piece of functionality. If you do decide to include Docker early on (to gain confidence with containerization), you can treat it as a separate optional ticket.

---

## EPIC 1: Core Agent & MVP Demo Setup

### Ticket 1.1: **Basic Python Project Initialization**
**Summary**  
- Create a simple Python project structure using a local environment (venv or pipenv).  
- Add a `requirements.txt` that includes `smolagents` and any essential libraries.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. A working virtual environment with a project folder layout.
2. `requirements.txt` specifying all dependencies (e.g., `smolagents`, `discord.py` if using Discord).
3. A basic `main.py` file that can be run locally without errors.

**Definition of Done**  
- Project can be started with a single command (`python main.py`), and no dependency errors occur.

---

### Ticket 1.2 (Optional): **Dockerize the Project**
**Summary**  
- For those comfortable with Docker (or want to learn), containerize the Python environment.  
- This is optional for the demo but can give you a head start on productionizing.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. A simple `Dockerfile` based on a Python image.
2. `docker build` completes successfully, creating an image named `exec-assistant`.
3. `docker run -it exec-assistant` launches the agent in a container.

**Definition of Done**  
- The Docker container runs locally, and the agent can be tested inside it.

> **Note**: If Docker feels too complex for now, skip this ticket. You can revisit it later once you’ve validated the core functionality.

---

## EPIC 2: Agent Core Functionality

### Ticket 2.1: **Implement the Task Management Module**
**Summary**  
- Create a minimalistic in-code data store (e.g., a Python list or dictionary) for tasks.  
- Provide CRUD functions: `create_task()`, `update_task()`, `delete_task()`, `list_tasks()`.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. A `task_manager.py` module with above functions.
2. Tasks can store at least title, description, status, and due date.
3. Demo test: a short script that creates, updates, lists tasks.

**Definition of Done**  
- Code runs without errors; tasks are printed or returned upon calling `list_tasks()`.

---

### Ticket 2.2: **Google Calendar Scheduling (Demo-Ready Version)**
**Summary**  
- Integrate with Google Calendar API to schedule an event.  
- For demo purposes, a single function that can authenticate and create a test event.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. Basic OAuth or API token flow for Google Calendar (any workable approach).
2. `schedule_event(title, start_time, end_time)` function that returns a success/failure message.
3. Minimal error handling (e.g., invalid dates).

**Definition of Done**  
- A test script (or command) that, when run, creates a sample event in a real or test Google Calendar.

---

### Ticket 2.3: **Knowledge Graph (Wikipedia) Integration**
**Summary**  
- Provide a function to fetch a Wikipedia article summary based on a topic.  
- Store article data (title, summary) in a simple Python data structure for reference.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. `fetch_wikipedia_article(topic)` function that returns a short summary.
2. A basic in-memory store for referencing previously fetched articles.
3. Ability to show/hide fetched summaries when asked.

**Definition of Done**  
- Running `fetch_wikipedia_article("Python_(programming_language)")` returns a short summary, and the data can be retrieved again.

---

## EPIC 3: User Interface (Demo-Focused)

### Ticket 3.1: **Discord Bot Interaction (Minimal Commands)**
**Summary**  
- Create a Discord bot that can receive basic commands (e.g., `!addTask`, `!scheduleEvent`) and respond with text confirmations.
- Demonstrate live usage for the MVP.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. A `discord_bot.py` that connects to Discord via a token in `.env`.
2. Commands: `!addTask [task info]`, `!listTasks`, `!scheduleEvent [title] [time]`.
3. Bot replies with user-friendly confirmation messages.

**Definition of Done**  
- Bot is online in a Discord test server, and each command triggers the correct agent action.

---

### Ticket 3.2: **Obsidian Integration (Simple Sync)**
**Summary**  
- Provide a minimal approach to pull tasks from a designated Obsidian note or folder.  
- For the demo, it might be as simple as reading a `.md` file containing tasks and pushing them into the task manager.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. A script or function that parses a local `.md` file for tasks (format flexible).
2. Imported tasks are stored in the agent’s task manager and can be listed or updated.
3. Changes from the agent can optionally be written back to the `.md` file.

**Definition of Done**  
- A local `.md` file with tasks is successfully parsed, and tasks appear in the agent’s data model.

---

## EPIC 4: Security & Privacy (Minimal Demo Compliance)

### Ticket 4.1: **Basic Data Persistence (Local Only)**
**Summary**  
- Store user data (tasks, any minimal user settings) in a local JSON file or SQLite DB.  
- For a demo, aim for a simple JSON file approach.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. Persistent file updated whenever tasks are added/removed.
2. Agent can read the file on startup to restore the previous state.
3. A simple backup approach (e.g., copying the file) or versioned files for data safety.

**Definition of Done**  
- Stopping and restarting the agent retains the same tasks.

---

### Ticket 4.2: **Consent & Basic Access Control**
**Summary**  
- Provide a minimal user consent flow—e.g., disclaimers about reading a local `.md` file or connecting to Google Calendar.  
- For the demo, a textual explanation is enough.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. A short prompt or banner in the console or Discord that states what data is being accessed.  
2. Confirmation from the user if reading/writing tasks or connecting to Google Calendar is allowed.

**Definition of Done**  
- The user can run `main.py`, see a message describing data usage, and proceed or exit.

---

## EPIC 5: Demonstration & Basic Testing

### Ticket 5.1: **Demo Script & Minimal Tests**
**Summary**  
- Prepare a simple demonstration script to walk through the MVP functionality.  
- Include a handful of unit tests or demonstration tests.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. A single Python script (e.g., `demo.py`) that calls each critical function in sequence (create tasks, schedule an event, fetch Wikipedia info, etc.).  
2. Enough coverage to ensure the system doesn’t crash (not full coverage).

**Definition of Done**  
- Running `python demo.py` provides a short, sequential demonstration of each feature.

## Critical Path to an MVP Demo

1. **EPIC 1**: Tickets 1.1 → 1.2 (Optional)  
   - *Basic environment or Docker container (optional).*
2. **EPIC 2**: Tickets 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3  
   - *Core agent capabilities: tasks, scheduling, knowledge fetching.*
3. **EPIC 3**: Tickets 3.1 → 3.2  
   - *Minimal UI: Discord commands + Obsidian file sync.*
4. **EPIC 4**: Tickets 4.1 → 4.2  
   - *Persist data locally + basic user consent messaging.*
5. **EPIC 5**: Ticket 5.1  
   - *Demo the integrated features and ensure basic reliability.*

---

### Where to Include Docker?
- If you decide to containerize **before** the MVP demo, tackle **Ticket 1.2** early.  
- If Docker is too intimidating right now, skip Ticket 1.2 until after you successfully demo the core functionality locally.

**Key Note**: The above plan optimizes for getting a working demo quickly, rather than full production deployment. When you’re ready to scale or invite other developers to contribute, you can introduce advanced CI/CD, refined Docker images, and thorough security audits.
