# Executive Assistant Agent Design Document

## Overview

Our goal is to create a personal executive assistant agent that empowers users to manage their projects, time, and priorities effectively. The agent will offer:

- **Project Management**: Organize and track tasks and milestones.
- **Time Management**: Assist with scheduling and time blocking.
- **Priority and Values Alignment**: Ensure tasks align with user-defined priorities.
- **Reflection and Accountability**: Facilitate regular reviews and progress tracking.
- **Flexibility and Understanding**: Adapt to user preferences and provide empathetic support.

## Architecture

The agent will be built using Python and the `smolagents` library, containerized with Docker for consistent deployment across environments.

### Components

1. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - **Discord Integration**: Utilize a Discord bot for user interaction, allowing input and output through messages and interactive buttons.
   - **Obsidian Integration**: Sync with Obsidian for seamless note-taking and knowledge management.

2. **Agent Core**:
   - **Task Management Module**: Handle task creation, tracking, and updates.
   - **Scheduler Module**: Integrate with Google Calendar for scheduling and reminders.
   - **Knowledge Graph Module**: Develop a personal knowledge graph grounded in Wikipedia articles, allowing users to build and customize their own schema over time.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - **Local Database**: Store user data securely on their device to ensure privacy and control.

### Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the agent via Discord or Obsidian.
2. **Processing**: The Agent Core processes inputs, updates tasks, schedules events, and manages the knowledge graph.
3. **Storage**: Data is stored locally, with regular backups to prevent data loss.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

- **Dockerize the Application**:
  - Create a `Dockerfile` to define the environment:
    ```dockerfile
    # Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
    FROM python:3.11-slim

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the requirements file into the container
    COPY requirements.txt .

    # Install the dependencies
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Copy the rest of the application code into the container
    COPY . .

    # Define the command to run the application
    CMD ["python", "main.py"]
    ```
  - Build and run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    # Build the Docker image
    docker build -t executive-assistant-agent .

    # Run the Docker container
    docker run -d --name exec-assistant -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data executive-assistant-agent
    ```
  - This setup ensures a consistent development environment and simplifies deployment.

### 2. Develop the Agent Core

- **Set Up `smolagents`**:
  - Install the library:
    ```bash
    pip install smolagents
    ```
  - Initialize the agent with necessary tools and models.

- **Implement Modules**:
  - **Task Management Module**: Use `smolagents` to create agents that can add, update, and track tasks.
  - **Scheduler Module**: Integrate with Google Calendar API to manage events and reminders.
  - **Knowledge Graph Module**: Utilize Wikipedia's API to fetch articles and allow users to build a personalized knowledge base.

### 3. Integrate User Interfaces

- **Discord Bot**:
  - Use the `discord.py` library to create a bot that interacts with users.
  - Set up commands and interactive buttons for task management and scheduling.

- **Obsidian Plugin**:
  - Develop a plugin that syncs notes and tasks between Obsidian and the agent.
  - Ensure seamless integration to enhance user experience.

### 4. Ensure Security and Privacy

- **Data Storage**:
  - Store all user data locally to maintain privacy.
  - Implement encryption and regular backups to protect data.

- **User Consent**:
  - Ensure the agent requests permission before accessing any personal data.
  - Provide clear options for users to control their data and privacy settings.

## Future Enhancements

While the initial implementation focuses on core functionalities, future developments could include:

- **Voice Interaction**: Incorporate voice commands and responses for hands-free interaction.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Provide insights into productivity patterns and suggest improvements.
- **Customization Options**: Allow users to personalize the agent's behavior, appearance, and responses.

## Conclusion

By following this design, you'll have a functional executive assistant agent up and running in a matter of hours. This agent will serve as a foundation for further enhancements, empowering users to manage their tasks and time effectively while maintaining control over their data and privacy.
